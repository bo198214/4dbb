<h1>4D Building Blocks</h1>
<h2>The Game</h2>
You are presented a four dimensional scene, containing some compounds
(on the main screen).<br>
(If you are not familiar with 4D concepts, please read first the 
introduction at the end.)
<ul>
<li>Your objective is to combine the given compounds yielding the goal.</li>
<li>You can choose a different scene with goal in the &quot;file&gt;objectives&quot; menu
(the previous scene and goal is then discarded).</li>
<li>By toggling &quot;Goal&quot;
you switch between seeing the scene and seeing the goal.</li>
<li>You can cycle through selecting the different compounds, with 
&quot;prev&quot; and &quot;next&quot;.</li>
<li>The selected compound is marked with a small circle in its center.</li>
<li>You can combine all compounds touching the currently selected with the
combine-button. The center of the combined compound is what was the
center of the selected compound. This is not necessarily in the middle
of the combined compound, if you want to move it into the center then
use &quot;barycenter&quot;. Note that the center can only be at a
integral position, so sometimes it is set randomly to a nearest unit cube center.</li>
<li>Assistingly you can see the coordinates of the axes (x,y,z,w) of the
small circle before &quot;Goal&quot;.
</ul>
Every action in the object control can also be performed by keystroke,
see the key control screen.<br>
The default key assignment is:
<ul>
<li>Use the <b>left-right</b>/<b>down-up</b> keys for the compound to
move along <b>x</b>/<b>y</b></li>
<li>Use shift <b>left-right/down-up</b> for the compound to move along
<b>w/z</b></li>
<li>Press two of the keys a,s,d,f at the same time for rotating the
compound in the corresponding plane. Where <b>f,d,s,a</b> corresponds to the axes
<b>x,y,z,w</b>. The first pressed axis is rotated into the secondly pressed.
axis.</li>
<li>Use the keys <b>x/v</b> to select the <b>prev/next</b> compound.</li>
<li>Use the key <b>c</b> to <b>combine</b> the selected compound with all bordering compounds.</li>
<li>Use <b>space bar</b> to toggle viewing the <b>goal</b>.</li>
<li>Use the keys <b>t/g/b</b> to change the 3d view rotation axis to
<b>x/y/z</b>.</li>
</ul>
You can rotate the view by moving your mouse up/down in the view
screen after selecting the desired action in the &quot;view
control&quot; panel (i.e. 3d rotation or 4d rotation and along which
plane, see below for more details of the underlying viewing model).

<h2>The view modes</h2>
Per default the red/cyan mode is presented to you, if you have no red/cyan
glasses, choose another mode via the &quot;view&quot; menu. The following
modes are available to you.
<dl>
<dt>&quot;flat&quot;</dt>
<dd> This is the most undesirable mode for viewing 4D scenes.
Nonetheless every one with at least one eye is able to use it.
Use it only if every other method fails for you in the moment.</dd>
<dt>&quot;parallel eye&quot;</dt>
<dd>If you have no difficulties to see the depth in magic eye
pictures probably you are able to use this mode or the crossed-eye mode.
You cannot determine absolute depth in that mode. Because the eyes
are parallel the focus angle cannot be used to determine the depth.
Simply focus the eyes to infinity behind the screen.
Though its not as accurate as the anaglyph mode, I like its brilliance.
</dd>
<dt>&quot;crossed eye&quot;</dt>
<dd>This mode is untested because I am unable to use it. So theoreticly focus
your eyes in front of the screen (if necessary take a pencil to focus on) 
so that the two pictures overlap and melt. Use the adjustment screen to verify
your viewing results.
</dd>
<dt>&quot;red/cyan&quot; or anaglyph</dt>
<dd>Take red/cyan glasses
(you can get cardboard-framed ones for less than a dollar) and enjoy
this stunning virtuality!</dd>
</dl>
Note that you should use the adsjustment screen to get an optimal
viewing experience. In the moment the adjustment screen is not very
sophisticated, but at least you should size the 1cm or 1&quot; square
to that size (by operating the vertical and horizontal screen resolution).

<h2>The View control</h2>
<p>We use the following view model:
There is a 4D scene and a 4D camera. The 4D camera projects the
4D scene to its 3D film/projection area. Depending on the viewing
mode this 3D area is recreated behind your screen from the viewpoint
of a 3D (stereo) camera.</p>
<p>You now can adjust the position and direction of the 3D and 4D camera.
Choose which camera and which translation axis/rotation axes to use in the
&quot;view control&quot; panel.
Generally the left mouse button is for rotation and the right
mouse button for translation. Draw the mouse with respective pressed
button vertically on the scene area and you will see the results.  

<h3>Perspectives and Projections</h3>
There are some different methods how to map 3D objects to a pictorial.
Most of them have 4D counterparts.
<dl>
<dt>Perspective Projection</dt>
<dd>
This is the most natural projection, which we can find on photographs for example.
Objects  in the background are depicted smaller than objects in the foreground.
Parallel depth lines join in one point in the picture. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
One drawback of the perspective projection is that we cannot
easily conclude the real lengths due to the depth shortening.
Of course no projection can preserve all lengths but it is already
of much help to preserve the lengths (or at least the ratio to the original)
parallel to the axes of the coordinate system,
especially for rectangular shapes as in technical drawing or (this) computer game.
Those projections are called <em>axonometric projections</em> (for further information
see <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/axometr.htm">here</a>).
</p><p>
To achieve this, one first defines the image of the trihedral on the picture 
(i.e. three vectors <code>u,v,w</code> attatched to a point <code>o</code>).
Then every point with the coordinates <code>(x,y,z)</code> is mapped
to the point <code>o+x*u+y*v+z*w</code> on the picture.
This is the same as if we apply the 2x3 matrix <code>(u,v,w)</code>
to the vector (x,y,z)<sup>T</sup> plus <code>o</code>, i.e. it
is aquivalent to beeing an affine transformation from 3D to 2D.
</p><p>
Each axonometric projection has a viewing axis, that is the axis
mapped to <code>o</code>. Depending on the length ratio of the <code>u,v,w</code>
one categorizes the axonometric projection into isometric, dimetric and trimetric
projections. Typical used axonometric projections are 
(we give ratios between the length of <code>u,v,w</code> and the 
angles from <code>(0,1)</code> to <code>u,v,w</code>):
</p><table border=1>
<tr><td><b>30&deg; Isometric Perspective</b></td><td>isometric</td><td> 1:1:1</td><td align="right"> 30&deg;/90&deg;/150&deg;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Military Perspective</td><td>isometric</td> <td>1:1:1</td> <td align="right">45&deg;/90&deg;/135&deg;</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Cavalier Perspective</b></td><td>dimetric</td><td>2:2:1</td><td align="right"> 0&deg;/90&deg;/45&deg;</tr>
<tr><td>Chinese Perspective</td><td>dimetric</td><td>2:2:1</td><td align="right"> 0&deg;/90&deg;/30&deg;</tr>
</table>

<p>   
On the other hand we have <em>parallel projections</em> and <em>orthogonal projections</em>.
Parallel projection: (parallel) rays mapping the object to the canvas.
Orthogonal projection: The rays hit the canvas perpendicular.
</p><p>
When asking which axonometric projections is useful for four dimensions,
we note that (except for scaling) the 30&deg; isometric perspective is the only one that is a
orthogonal projection (with the eye looking from <code>(1,1,1)</code> to <code>(0,0,0)</code>).
And the cavalier perspective is the only one that leaves
all except the last axis untouched and the last
axis has the same angle to each other axis in the image. 
(Though this is true for the military projection with the y-axis too.)
Both descriptions can easily be extended to <code>n</code> dimensions.
And so we do to 4 dimensions (while we always use perspective projection for 3D).
</p> 
<p>
The axonometric projections all use a fixed viewing angle so 4D rotation
is disabled with them.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
For a really recommendable introduction look at the <a
href="http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/vis/vis.html">4D
Visualization Page</a>. As a starting point have also a look at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_dimension">Wikipedia's 4th
dimension</a>. The rest of this chapter is only a quick
patch introduction.
<p>In opposite to the most spread idea of the time being the 4th dimension we
consider here a truly 4 dimensional space, that is with 4 orthogonal
<em>space</em> axes. Of course in our physical space we cannot put
4 axes together so that each is orthogonal to each other.
On a paper we similarely can not draw 3 orthogonal lines but anyway
most pictures show 3 dimensional content.
Maybe a four dimensional beeing uses its pictures
(i.e. 3 dimensional cuboids) to depict 4 dimensional content. And so
we will do.</p>

<p>The four dimensional space is the straight forward generalization of the 
movement from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 dimensions.
So most questions for 4 dimensions can be answered when looking at the
relation of the 2 (flatland) and 3 dimensional (our physical) space.
Let us clarify the following questions:
<dl> 
<dt>What happens if a 4D sphere is pushed through our space?</dt>
<dd>Not yet explained.</dd>
<dt>What are rotation axes in 4D space?</dt>
<dd>
In 2 dimensions we have a rotation center.
In 3 dimensions we have a rotation axis.
In 4 dimensions we have a rotation plane.
But we dont need that many axes to describe a rotation.
Given to different directions there is in each dimension a uniquely
determined rotation transforming the first direction into the second. 
In general a rotation is a length and orientation preserving geometric
transformation, or in other words where the determinant of the
transformation matrix is 1. 
</dd>
<dt>What does a 4 dimensional cube look like?</dt>
<dd>Not yet explained.</dd>
<dt>How many and what platonic solids are there in 4D space?</dt>
<dd>See <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/platonic4d/">The Platonic Solids in 4D</a> (By Paul Bourke) and further

<dt>Does a four dimensional space really exists?</dt>
<dd>Not yet explained.</dd>
