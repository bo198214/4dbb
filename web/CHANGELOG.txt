0.7 beta, 2006-01-22:
  controlled startup window size
  resizing window does no more result in heap overflow

0.8 beta
  fixed oversight, that caused rotated shapes showing wrong faces
  rotating view now rotates around the center of
    the selected compound
  added zoom
  
0.8.1 beta
  changing polar coordinates now centers camera on 0
  added some tooltips in view control
  
0.9.1
  level system
  added sounds
  two additional objectives
  renamed v1,v2,v3,v4 into x,y,z,w
  recognizes now non-reachable goal before only one compound is left
  fixed that mouse had to be over the view screen for keyboard input being possbile
  
Planned:
  core model mode: instead of displaying the cubes only
    the centers are displayed and lines between adjacent centers
  More, and more sophisticated objectives
  Nicer Viewing Axes
  Customizable keys
  save configuration/state
  4D covering surfaces (occlusion culling), at least for the axonometric projections
  4D surface mode, fold surfaces like cube, torus and Klein-bottle
