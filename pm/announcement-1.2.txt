Dear lovers of 4 dimensional space,

I finished the new version 1.2 of my 4D Building Blocks game (4DBB).
Now it is exclusively able to cull 4d occlusions (not just backface)
in arbitrary scenes made up of unit tesseracts and has fancy transparent
display controls. 

If you ever wanted to know how to get an item out of a closed 3d box in 4d,
or why in 4d there can be no (1d) knots, make your own experience in this game!
Some cool new levels and superb sound are added.

Tell me about your ideas for objectives to be added. 
You can easily create your own levels by specifying the integer locations
of the unit tesseracts. 
The game (non-applet version) is able to load and save levels,
look into a saved file for the format.  

You can find the game here:

You can either download, play as applet, or Java web start the application.
Let me know what you think.

Sincerely yours,
